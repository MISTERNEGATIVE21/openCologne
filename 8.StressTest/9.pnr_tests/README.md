These tests were originaly written by Mike Reznikov and they can be found on the link: ttps://github.com/mirekez/pnr_tests

The tests present a generic Verilog generator. By playing with parameters, different parts of design can be converted to RAM/SRL/DSP blocks. It also generates XDC to randomly assign pins, which is an auxiliary functionality tied to Xilinx.

We have ported these tests to run for the CologneChip CCGM1A1. The resaults that we got by running these tests can be found in the table below:



##WIP
At the moment we are still working on porting these tests onto the Gowin GW2AR-18C with the goal of comparing it with CCGM1A1.
