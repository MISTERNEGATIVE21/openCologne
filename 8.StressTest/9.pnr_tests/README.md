# PNR_TESTS
## WIP

- https://github.com/mirekez/pnr_tests (this is a generic Verilog generator. By playing with parameters, different parts of design can be converted to RAM/SRL/DSP blocks. It also generates XDC to randomly assign pins, which is an auxiliary functionality tied to Xilinx. Dialects for other vendors can also be created).
