# Routing network architecture assessment

## * WORK IN PROGRESS * UNDER CONSTRUCTION *
> WHILE THIS NOTICE IS PRESENT, DON'T EXPECT DESIGN, SIM, OR ANY OTHER FILE IN HERE 2BE DOIN' WHAT IT'S SAYIN'

This part relies on pure network theory and provided documentation from CologneChip to derive some theoretical limits of the routing architecture, ruling out the routing tool's ability when evaluating the quality of the architecture.

Work is organized in a python notebook, generating the network model and running tests on the model. Sometimes later a VTR approach might replace the python framework, but for now it remains a purely theoretical consideration.
