## PCM5102 Audio DAC Board

The PCM5102 Audio DAC Board is really popular, and sells under different P/N like for example: [CJMCU-5102], [GY-PCM5102](https://www.amazon.de/iHaospace-Interface-PCM5102-GY-PCM5102-Raspberry/dp/B07V6K9RQ7) and [DIYMORE-5102](https://www.diymore.cc/products/i2s-pcm5102-dac-decoder-32bit-player-module-than-es9023-pcm1794-for-raspberry-pi).
The board we will use is the DIYMORE-5102 that doesn't have a ready made schematic available online, so the schematic addes is for the CJMCU-5102 board, but the chip datasheet is for the PCM5102 chip.
