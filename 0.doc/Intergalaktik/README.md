# Extension Boards

## PCM5102 Audio DAC Board

The PCM5102 Audio DAC board is widely used and sold under various part numbers, such as [CJMCU-5102](https://www.bestarduino.com/p2327/CJMCU-5102-Stereo-Digital-To-Analog-Converter-PLL-Voice-Module-PCM5102A-DAC.html), [GY-PCM5102](https://www.amazon.de/iHaospace-Interface-PCM5102-GY-PCM5102-Raspberry/dp/B07V6K9RQ7), and [DIYMORE-5102]((https://www.diymore.cc/products/i2s-pcm5102-dac-decoder-32bit-player-module-than-es9023-pcm1794-for-raspberry-pi).

In this project, we are using the DIYMORE-5102 board. Unfortunately, a dedicated schematic for this specific board isn't readily available online. Therefore, we have provided the [schematic](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/pcm5102.Audio-DAC_schematic.png) for the similar CJMCU-5102 board. For reference, we also included the [datasheet](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/pcm5102.Audio-DAC.pdf) for the PCM5102 chip, which is used in all of these boards.

## I2S Mic Board

The I2S Mic Extension Board can be found on [ulx3s-extensions](https://github.com/goran-mahovlic/ulx3s-extensions/tree/master/I2S_MIC). All of the KiCAD files are available to view. The [schematic](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/i2c_mic_schematic.pdf) and [microphone chip](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/i2s_mic_datasheet.PDF) are placed in the documentation folder. 

Below are shown the front and back of the I2C Mic Board from KiCad 3D view. 

The I2S Mic Extension Board is available on the [ulx3s-extensions](https://github.com/goran-mahovlic/ulx3s-extensions/tree/master/I2S_MIC) repository, where all the KiCAD design files can be viewed. Additional documentation, including the [schematic](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/i2c_mic_schematic.pdf) and the [microphone chip datasheet]((https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/openCologne/blob/main/0.doc/Intergalaktik/i2s_mic_datasheet.PDF)), is located in the documentation folder.

Below, you can see the front and back views of the I2S Mic Board, rendered in KiCad's 3D viewer.
