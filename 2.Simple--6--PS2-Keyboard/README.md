# PS/2 Keyboard

The PS/2 port DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its name comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. Here we have a PS/2 keyboard 

## The Physical Interface

The physical PS/2 port is one of two styles of connectors:  The 5-pin DIN or the 6-pin mini-DIN.  Both connectors are completely (electrically) similar; the only practical difference between the two is the arrangement of pins.  This means the two types of connectors can easily be changed with simple hard-wired adaptors
