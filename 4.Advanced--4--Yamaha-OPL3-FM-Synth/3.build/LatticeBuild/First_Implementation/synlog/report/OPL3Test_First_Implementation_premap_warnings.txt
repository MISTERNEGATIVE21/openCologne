@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/user/openCologne/4.Advanced--4/1.hw/modules/clks/src/reset_sync.sv":58:4:58:12|Found inferred clock opl3|clk which controls 1364 sequential elements including reset_sync.r2_0. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
